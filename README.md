# MFCC_Music_Genre_Classification
This project was completed as part of the Cloud-Based Data Analytics (MIE1628) course at the University of Toronto and looks at using Mel-Frequency Spectral Coefficients (MFCCs) of songs to be able to classify their genre. The project was completed using a notebook in Azure Machine Learning Studio and makes use of the [FMA Dataset](https://github.com/mdeff/fma).
